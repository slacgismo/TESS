There are three types of users in TESS:
1. Member - Members are utility customers. Members have access to TESS Mobile but do not have access to the TESS Control Room.  
2. Staff - Utility staff members with access to the TESS Control Room.
3. Admin - Utility staff members with access to the Administration Panel of TESS Control Room. They can manage permissions for other Staff members.
