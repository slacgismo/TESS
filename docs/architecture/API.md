# TESS API Documentation

Modularity and Extensibility are two key goals for TESS. We want to make it
as simple as possible for developers to integrate TESS into their apps, tools,
backends, and platforms. This document describes how developers can interact
with TESS API. The table below links to each of the API Endpoints exposed via
TESS API.
